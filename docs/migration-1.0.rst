Migrating to 1.0
================

1.0 removes the names and behaviour listed here. Each entry gives the 0.x call
and what replaces it. The guide grows with each 1.0 change until the release.

A document has no close state
-----------------------------

A document reads its whole package into memory when it opens and holds no
file, so there is nothing to close. The context manager, ``close_vsdx()`` and
the closed-document error are gone, and a document can be edited for as long
as you hold it.

``with VisioFile(path) as vis:``
   Assign instead. ``with`` now raises ``TypeError`` (``AttributeError`` on
   Python 3.10).

   .. code-block:: python

      # 0.x
      with VisioFile("diagram.vsdx") as vis:
          vis.pages[0].name = "Current state"
          vis.save_vsdx()

      # 1.0
      vis = VisioFile("diagram.vsdx")
      vis.pages[0].name = "Current state"
      vis.save_vsdx()

``VisioFile.close_vsdx()``
   Delete the call. Nothing needs releasing.

``VisioFile.file_open``
   Delete the check. A document is always open.

``vsdxkit.errors.VisioFileNotOpen``
   Delete the ``except`` clause. Nothing raises it. A write through a shape
   that has been deleted from its page still raises
   :class:`vsdxkit.errors.InvalidOperationError`.
